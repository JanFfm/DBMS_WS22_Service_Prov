# DBMS_WS22/23: Service Provider


1. A Mongo DB Service has to be run in the background 

    On first use: run "python CreateDatabase.py" to initialize Database

2. Start backend services by running "flask run" in the same directory as "auth.py"
3. Start frontend services by running "npm start" in "frontend" directory

    For this it is necessary to have node.js installed and initialize dependencies by running "npm install" in "frontend" directory

4. Frontend can be accessed via http://localhost:3000 (backend is at http://localhost:5000)
